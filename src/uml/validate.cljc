  "Structural validation for uml.model models, returning
  kotoba.dsl.problem-shaped problems (:uml/severity :error|:warn).

  :error means the model is not structurally valid UML (dangling type
  reference, illegal Generalization cycle, duplicate member name, too few
  Association ends, an AssociationClass violating its disjoint-names
  constraint). :warn means the model IS structurally legal per the
  metamodel but this validator flags it as unusual/out of v1 scope (an
  Interface owning an attribute -- see interface-attribute-problems).

  Known v1 simplifications (see README Follow-ups for the full list):
  - Reference checks confirm a name resolves to SOME known Classifier (or
    a `uml.model/primitive-types` name), not that it resolves to the
    RIGHT KIND (e.g. an InterfaceRealization's contract should be an
    Interface specifically).
  - Duplicate-member-name checking treats any two Operations sharing a
    name on one Classifier as illegal, even though real UML permits
    Operation overloading distinguished by parameter-list signature (sec
    9.4.3) -- v1 does not compare signatures."
